The Notetaker's responsibility lies in recording key meeting items. They make sure decisions, parked topics, and questions are all recorded and noted for later. 

However, you should still employ some form of manual recording to keep the main discussion points and conclusions on hand. You can use the chat section for this and have your main points and questions automatically saved and easily accessible for future reference. 

For example, you can type out main action points as a bullet list in a team channel in your team chat app. This way, you can bulk send meeting notes to everyone and have all the participants immediately notified when you press send. 

Notetakers also work closely with the Leader and/or the Facilitator to develop the meeting agenda. 

In addition, they are in charge of organizing the notes and distributing them to the participants. 

Strong attention to detail and the ability to quickly comprehend and record verbal communication are some of the key traits Notetakers need to possess. 

Aside from their role responsibilities, Notetakers are also active participants in meetings. 

In line with this, it's important to assign this role to skilled multitaskers who have a thorough enough knowledge of the agenda and the group dynamic to perform the two-role assignment successfully. 

Tips for Notetakers in meetings

As a Notetaker, your duties go well beyond paying close attention throughout the meeting and typing super fast. 

To help you master this role from the get-go, we've compiled a list of additional things to consider when taking on a Notetaker role:

- Get a good grasp of industry jargon. Ensure that you understand the industry- or agenda-specific terminology to be able to transcribe any technical terms or acronyms quickly and accurately. 
- Come prepared. Charge your laptop and any other devices you plan on using. You can also have some paper and a pen on hand just in case something unexpected happens with the equipment.  
- Master your writing. It's paramount to get the right message across and leave no room for misinterpretation when compiling meeting recordings. To effectively format your meeting notes, go for clarity, conciseness, and skim-friendly formating.

The Leader or the Chair is a key meeting role in both virtual and in-person meetings.

The role is given to the head of the team who is responsible for putting together the agenda and assigning other meeting roles. 

In addition to these duties, the Leader takes care of several key elements before, during, and after the meeting. 
The Leader's responsibilities before the meeting

- Arranges the meeting 
- Sends meeting invitations
- Prepares and coordinates the agenda

The Leader's responsibilities during the meeting 

- Establishes objectives, roles, and rules
- Monitors the facilitator in keeping the discussion on track
- Ensures everyone is given equal opportunity to participate in the conversation

The Leader's responsibilities after the meeting 

- Ensures all key decisions are effectively communicated 
- Defines the next steps
- Ensures the team members are assigned responsibilities

Tips for Leaders in meetings

Now that you have a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the meeting Leader, here are a couple of actionable tips to help you chair your next meeting like a pro:  

- Identify the goal(s) of the meeting in advance. This will help you assess the progress better during the meeting and determine if the main objective has been met in the end. 
- Coordinate the plan with other key figures. To minimize interruptions, delays, or misunderstandings, it's a good idea to prepare a plan of action, duties, and cues with Facilitators, Timekeepers, Notetakers, and Tech Hosts. 
- Leave room for questions. Allocate enough time during the meeting for participants to ask questions. In addition to ensuring maximum clarity and transparency, you're also creating an inclusive experience for all participants.
- Give the final word. Be sure to send brief notes to all the participants after the meeting. These are especially applicable to larger, all-hands meetings, for example. It can be a great way to express your gratitude to everyone for participating. It can also serve as a reminder of the key points and action items.   

Leader vs Facilitator in meetings

The Leader and Facilitator roles are often assumed by the same person. 

Although the two roles are similar, and the terms are often used interchangeably, they can have distinct responsibilities. 

The meeting Leader role is exclusively reserved for someone from the team. In most cases, the team lead assumes the position of the meeting Lead. 

The meeting Facilitator role, on the other hand, can be entrusted to people outside the team, or even outside the organization. 

While the meeting Leader is in charge of meeting outcomes, the Facilitator takes a more active role during the meeting as they control the process of the meeting. 

In many cases, the Leader can facilitate or ask another team member to facilitate the team meeting. 

However, it might be a good practice to invite a skilled outsider in one of the following scenarios: 

- The team is still in the early stages of working together
- There's a high chance of a disruption in the group dynamic
- There's a complex or sensitive topic on the agenda

The Facilitator's role is similar to that of the meeting Leader. In many organizations, one person is assigned both roles as they share the majority of duties. 

However, to make a clear distinction, we will define the role of the Facilitator with responsibilities specific to this role.

The Facilitator's main responsibility is to keep the conversation on track. 

Unlike the Leader, who mostly oversees the meeting, the Facilitator has a more active role in moderating the discussion and guiding the decision-making process. 

Like the Leader, the Facilitator role also includes responsibilities before, during, and after a meeting. 
The Facilitator's responsibilities before the meeting

- Meets with the Leader or session sponsors to clarify the expectations, main goals, tone, and group dynamics 
- Determines the best methods and tools to use 
- Assists the Leader in organizing the meeting and planning the agenda

The Facilitator's responsibilities during the meeting

- Moderates the conversation throughout the meeting to make sure it follows the main agenda items. They have to be skilled active listeners and great communicators to act fast when it's time to intervene and redirect the conversation. 
- Sets the tone of the meeting at the beginning. 
- Creates an inclusive environment. Ensures virtual participants are included and engaged in hybrid teams' meetings.
- Neutralizes potential group conflicts. This role requires a high level of emotional intelligence to be able to understand how others may feel and guide the group toward a constructive discussion and avoid miscommunication. 

The Facilitator's responsibilities after the meeting

- Assists the Leader in defining and communicating conclusions and next steps. 

Tips for Facilitators in meetings

Whether you're a seasoned meeting Facilitator or a first-timer, you can never be overprepared.

After all, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for meeting facilitation — every group, discussion, and agenda is unique and brings different dynamics and communication challenges. 

That said, there are still a couple of tips any facilitator can apply to improve meeting productivity: 

- Meet your audience. Ideally, you'll have a chance to assess the dynamic of the group and get a better insight into the personality traits and communication styles of the participants. This will help you determine how best to address the participants.   
- Be mindful and observant. Before and during the meeting, make sure to carefully read the room to better predict behavior and act fast when digressions or misunderstandings occur. 
- Ask the right questions. Contrary to popular belief, the role of the Facilitator is not to know all the answers, but to ask the right questions to guide the conversation toward solutions. Be sure to actively listen and chime in with the right question at the right time to elicit more meaningful conclusions. 
- Keep the flow going. In addition to moving the conversation forward with the right questions, it's also a good idea to keep the group engaged and even physically active during the meeting. For in-person meetings, this can be achieved with stand-up meetings. Or, you can ask the participants to get up and write their ideas on the whiteboard. In virtual meetings, you can do a stand-up meeting as well, or include appropriate ice breaker games.
